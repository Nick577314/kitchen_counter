In Dart and Flutter, a Future represents a value that may not be available immediately because it requires some asynchronous operation to complete, such as a network request or reading a file. It represents the result of an asynchronous computation that will complete later with a value or an error.

In Dart, the question mark (?) is the null-aware access operator. It is used to conditionally access members (properties or methods) of an object when the object itself may be null.

When you write object?.property, it means "if object is not null, access the property of object, otherwise return null." This operator allows you to safely access members without causing a null reference exception.

In the code snippet provided, the null-aware access operator is used in the condition of the ternary operator (?:) to check if a specific nutrition type exists in the nutrientsVar map. It determines whether the key exists in the map, and if it does, the corresponding value is accessed. If the key doesn't exist (which means the nutrition type is missing in the response), the operator returns a default value of 0.0.

Here's an example to illustrate the usage of the null-aware access operator:
            String? nullableString = null;
            int length = nullableString?.length ?? 0;
            print(length); // Output: 0
